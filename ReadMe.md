# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I’m a passionate developer at the start of my journey, diving deep into UI/UX design and front-end development. My goal is to create beautiful, user-friendly websites and applications that people love to use. In the future, I’m aiming to expand my skill set to become a full-stack developer, and I’m always excited to connect with others who share a love for coding and design!<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on - Learning and building mini-projects to explore UI/UX design principles and front-end development. My goal is to create interfaces that are as intuitive as they are visually appealing!<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on - Front-end projects that focus on design and user experience. I’m eager to join projects where I can apply and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and maybe React!). If you have a cool idea, let’s connect!<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with - Best practices in UI/UX and learning about tools like Figma and Adobe XD. Any tips on bridging the gap between design and code are welcome!<br>🌱 I’m currently learning - All things front-end development! I’m diving into JavaScript frameworks (React is up next!) and understanding responsive design to make web applications look great on any device. I’m also exploring back-end basics to prepare for full-stack development in the future.<br>💬 Ask me about - Getting started in front-end development or my journey with UI/UX. I’m happy to share what I’m learning or discuss how to make websites more engaging and user-friendly!<br>
